var title = "Cinderella";
var author = "unknown";
var description = "";/*"Folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust 
oppression/triumphant reward. Thousands of variants are known 
throughout the world. The title character is a young woman living 
in unfortunate circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable 
fortune. The story was first published by Charles Perrault in 
Histoires ou contes du temps pass√© in 1697, and later by the 
Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales.
<br>
Although both the story's title and the character's name change 
in different languages, in English-language folklore 'Cinderella' 
is the archetypal name. The word 'cinderella' has, by analogy, come 
to mean one whose attributes were unrecognized, or one who 
unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of 
obscurity and neglect. The still-popular story of 'Cinderella' 
continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending 
plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media."*/
